 ## Project Description

---

MyCurrency as named is designed to provide real time currency conversion rate to its users.
It allows its users convert the value of one currency to another. It also provides a convenient and efficient way to perform currency conversions for various needs, it can also be used in financial plannings especially when it involves other currencies.
It also seek to educate its users by providing a list of countries and their currencies. Through it, users are able to build up understanding about different currencies that exists and thier symbols. 


---

## Site Owners Goal

---

   * To educate its users on currencies around the world.
   * Provide real time currency exchange rate.
   * Provide access to currency conversion with ease.
   * Register its users.
   * First time users needs to sign up to use.

   
---

## Users Goal

---

   * To easily navigate and understand the application.
   * Be able to view the list and perform desired conversion.
   * To be able to view the exchange rate.


---

## Target Audience

---

People in need of financial rates across different countries.
People that seek to trade in foreign currencies.

---

## Wireframes

---

Lucid Chart was used in planning the project.

Link for my thought on the project is found ![here](assets/images/wireframes)

## Features

---

### Existing Features

Features on the application include:



 
## Future Features

---

 * I will add audio to improve user experience of the game.

 * Add an autosave feature.

 * Features that allow users to choose some custom settings to personalize the game.

 * Randomize the position of each option.

 * Add a reward section where users can choose a gift based on the scores they get.

 * Connect with social media account of users to provide a means to share the game scores online.

---

## Design Choices

---


* For simplicity and my hope to learn more so that users can improve the game appearance to their desired choice, I have opted to use linear gradient to design the body.

* I have added box shadow to the sections to better present it to users.


### Font

* Andika
    * I believe it is a clean font for this game and its bold, its source is google font.
* Sans-serif
    * This is set as a fall-back font for device that might not load google fonts and its easily available.


### Colour Scheme

   
I have selected a mix of blue shades **(rgb(32,201, 255) 36.7%)**, **(rgb(52, 79, 88) 84.4%)**, **black** and **White** to complement site appearance.
Using [color contrast checker](https://dequeuniversity.com/) have checked the contrast of both colors use as foreground and background. Contrast result gave the following.

I have maintained a button text color change to white on hovering to alert the user of the mouse presence on each button.

--- 

## Accessibility

---

This project is a terminal based program, users are prompted for input to move through the application.



---

## Technology, Frameworks and Programs

---

### Language

* PYTHON

---

### Frameworks and Programs


* LucidChart
    * Used to sketch my thought in planing the project


* Github
    * To store written code


* Gitpod
    * This is the IDE used to write the code from where i can push to github.


---

## Bugs

---

### Fixed Bugs

* Rows not appendeing in the worksheet
    *Converting my data to list before appending helped fixed this


### Unfixed Bugs
 * To my current understanding, there is no unfixed bug
